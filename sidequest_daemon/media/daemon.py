"""sidequest-renderer daemon — persistent Z-Image renderer on Unix domain socket.

Hosts the Z-Image worker in a single process with the model pre-loaded.
Serves render requests over a Unix domain socket, routing by tier.
Stays warm between sessions.

Usage:
    sidequest-renderer                          # start daemon (loads Z-Image)
    sidequest-renderer --warmup=flux            # start + load Z-Image only
    sidequest-renderer --no-warmup              # start without loading models (testing)
    sidequest-renderer --shutdown               # send shutdown to running daemon
    sidequest-renderer --status                 # check daemon status
    sidequest-renderer --genre-packs /path      # set genre packs directory
    sidequest-renderer --output-dir /path       # set output directory
