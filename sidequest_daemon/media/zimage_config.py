"""Z-Image tier configuration — maps RenderTier to generation parameters.

Importable by the main package for tests and wiring. The worker subprocess
duplicates this table (it cannot import from sidequest_daemon).

Migrated to Z-Image Turbo (Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo) 2026-04-26 per S4-PERF
investigation. Turbo is LCM-distilled — `supports_guidance=False` in mflux's
ModelConfig, so guidance is fixed at 0.0 (CFG is a no-op for the distilled
model). Step count drops from 20 → 8, yielding the targeted ~4× speedup
(~108s → ~30s) for the chargen render path.

Story 45-38 (2026-04-30) added a parallel **high-fidelity** table for
genre-pack pre-gen using base Z-Image 1.0 at 20 steps + CFG 4.0. The two
tables coexist; ``get_zimage_config(tier, fidelity)`` is the single lookup
point for callers (composer, worker, OTEL spans). In-session live
narration omits the fidelity arg and stays on Turbo for latency.
