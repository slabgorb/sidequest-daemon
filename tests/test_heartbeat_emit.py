"""RED tests — Story 45-31 — daemon-side heartbeat emission (AC1, AC2, AC6).

The daemon emits a per-queue heartbeat event line on every state
transition so the server-side ``DaemonStateMirror`` can track liveness
without polling. Heartbeat shape::

    {"event": "heartbeat",
     "queue": "image" | "embed",
     "state": "ready" | "busy" | "paused" | "cold",
     "queue_depth": <int>,
     "ts_monotonic": <float>}

Distinguishable from request replies by the presence of an ``event``
key (replies carry ``id`` + ``result`` / ``error``).

Scope (per the story context):
  - AC1: heartbeats emit on connection accept (ready), render-lock
    acquire (busy), render-lock release (ready).
  - AC1 negative: an embed call MUST NOT emit a ``queue="image"`` busy
    heartbeat.
  - AC2: idle daemon emits a periodic ready heartbeat at the
    configured interval (default 30s).
  - AC6: heartbeat lines coexist with the per-request result line and
    do not break existing clients — a client that ignores ``event``
    lines still parses replies cleanly.

Testing strategy: spin up the real ``_handle_client`` against an
in-process Unix socket with a stub ``WorkerPool`` whose ``render``
blocks until the test releases. Read all lines off the wire and
classify by JSON shape.
